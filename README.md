# lombscargle
Lomb-Scargle periodogram of planet orbiting star at random intervals

### Data  
There are three data sets. Each one contains a series of unevenly spaced redshift measurements of a planet orbiting a star. Remote mirrors are also included.

### Getting started
The code works on one data set at a time. Uncomment the data set to be used and plots will be generated at each step.
